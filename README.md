# Extraordinary Extra Totems
This Fabric mod introduces six unique Totems of Undying to your world, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Collect Totem Remnants scattered all around the world, craft the new totems, and use them in battle! And after a long journey, why don't you display them in your treasure room as stunning 3D models?

## Items
To get started, you'll need to get your hands on a new item called Totem Remnants.

Totem Remnants can be obtained in a variety of ways, such as:
* Activating any Totem of Undying (both vanilla and new ones)
* Killing Evokers
* Looting chests in structures
* Trading with Wandering Traders

### Crafting recipes

Once you've obtained enough Totem Remnants, you will be able to craft any of the five new totems, which include:
* Unstable Totem of Undying
* Unreliable Totem of Undying
* Confused Totem of Undying
* Strange Totem of Undying
* Fragile Totem of Undying

While it sounds like a good way to get some additional totems, each has its own downsides, so be sure to choose wisely. For example, the Unreliable Totem of Undying only works in 80% of the times, which explains its name. As for the other totems, well... You'll have to find out for yourself!

*But wait, that's only five totems. What about the last one?*

![crafting recipe 4 ominous totem remnants plus 1 of any regular totem equals ominous totem](/images/image5.png)

To craft the Ominous Totem of Undying, you'll need a regular totem and a few Ominous Totem Remnants, which can only be found in Nether structures. Because of that, you will have to spend some time traversing the world before getting enough remnants to craft this totem. Totally worth the effort, though: when activated, it provides you with a custom status effect in addition to some strong vanilla effects.
## Effects
Upon activating the Ominous Totem of Undying, the player is granted a new status effect called Death's Favor. While under this effect, the player becomes nearly immortal, since in most circumstances, their health won't drop below 1 HP. This effect is highly beneficial, making your life so much easier without any serious downsides.

...right?

## Placeable totems
Did somebody say placeable totems?

That's right, any totem can now be placed on the ground as a 3D model! It's definitely easier to show them off to everyone else in this way. However, placing your totem on the groung during a fight would be quite unfortunate, so keep in mind that you can only do that while sneaking.
