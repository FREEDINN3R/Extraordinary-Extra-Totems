# Extraordinary Extra Totems
This is a small Fabric mod which will bring a few new Totems of Undying to your world. Each of the new 5 craftable totems will provide you with the same utility as a regular Totem of Undying, but with some downsides. And the last, 6th totem can only be crafted out of rare pieces scattered around the world.

## Items
To craft the new totems, you will need to find the new item called Totem Remnants.

You may get them by activating any Totem of Undying (both vanilla and new ones), killing Evokers, looting structure chests, or trading with the Wandering Trader.
### New recipes

Using 8 Totem Remnants and any mineral, you will be able to craft one of the new totems. These 5 can be crafted in such a way:
* Unstable Totem of Undying
* Unreliable Totem of Undying
* Confused Totem of Undying
* Strange Totem of Undying
* Fragile Totem of Undying

While it seems like a good way to provide renewable totems, keep in mind that each has its own downsides. For example, the Unreliable Totem of Undying is quite... unreliable, and thus works only in 80% of times. As for the others, the player will have to guess for themsleves what downsides they have, based on their names.

![crafting recipe 4 ominous totem remnants plus 1 of any regular totem equals ominous totem](/images/image5.png)

As for the last, 6th totem, its crafting recipe requires special material called Ominous Totem Remnants. These can only be rarely found in Nether structures, and because of this, the player will have to spend some time travelling before finally getting this totem. When used, this totem will provide its user with some powerful effect, as well as a new status effect.
## Effect

After activating the Ominous Totem of Undying, the player will be granted a new status effect called Death's Favor. While under this effect, the player becomes nearly immortal - that is, in most circumstances their health cannot drop below 1 HP. Indeed, this sounds like a great deal, which will greatly benefit your gameplay and has no seriuos downsides.

...right?

## Placeable totems
Did somebody say placeable totems?

That's right, with this mod, any totem can be placed on the ground as a 3D model, which makes it way easier to show 'em off to your friends. However, placing your totem on the groung while fighting would be quite unfortunate, so keep in mind that you can only do that while sneaking.
